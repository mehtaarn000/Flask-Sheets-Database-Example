## Step 3
Get your required credentials for the API:
1. Click "Enable"
2. Select your project.
3. You will be taken back to the main console screen. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" wherever it is on your screen.
4. You wil be taken to the credentials page. There should be a number of questions about what you will be doing with the API on your screen. Fill out these questions.
