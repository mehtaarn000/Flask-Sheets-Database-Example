## Steps
Read the following steps to learn how to use these APIs to create a database.

### Step 1
Sign up for a Google Developer Account if you haven't already [here](https://developers.google.com/).

### Step 2
Get your required credentials for the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs.

### Step 3
Share your google sheet with the gmail account given by the APIs.

### Installation and Usage
Clone this repository and cd into the project directory:

```

cd FlaskSheetsDatabaseExample
```

Run the server with the `webserver` function in app.py (takes arguments: host, port, the google sheets name, and your credentials file)

Input a username and password, and check your sheet. The username and password (which is hashed) should be present.
